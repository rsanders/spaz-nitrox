	<h1>Spaz What's New (Changelog)</h1>


	<div id="known-issues">
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>User CSS file not yet working &ndash; new AIR Beta 2 security sandboxing requires additional refactoring</li>

		<li>Altered About and Info popups: now have close icons, and links work properly again</li>
		<li>Char count in entry box (default theme) doesn't get covered by long messages anymore</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h2>0.2.6 (2007-10-02)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Updated app to work with AIR Beta 2 (<strong>will not work with Beta 1</strong>).  This fixes most known issues.  (Port to Beta 2 primarily performed by Alexandru Chiculita; very special thanks to him and the rest of the AIR engineering team)</li>

	</ul>


	<h2>0.2.3 (2007-09-19)</h2>
